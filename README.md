# Default_State
Failure Mode Thinking -- a chautauqua 

The default state of technology, any technology from flint axes to network switches to your digital watch -- the default state of technology is "broken". Technology as a definition is something that is created and thus must be maintained. The axe is possibly the earliest and easiest example: axes that aren't sharp are spectacularly bad axes. For really, really long time we survived on technology and tools that were only moderately more complicated than our own fingers and teeth, and thus technology was relatively easy to maintain and manage, but still: a dull knife is a failure mode. A snapped bowstring is a failure mode. And it requires time, attention, and effort to keep the technology of life out of failure mode and in a usable condition. And this is a condition that becomes more and more true as systems become more complex and civilization becomes, well... civilization.

So how do we, as citizens of a modern society which requires specialized and compartmentalized knowledge to maintain and repair, think about failure? Should we? And if so, how?

Questions to ask:
  * how you you define "failure" personally?
  * how do you think about failure in your day-to-day life? Or do you? If not, is there another type of focus that you use as your guide?
  * what do you think you can learn about life from failures?
  * what is the greatest failure you were ever a part of?
  * what would you suggest to others about failure in their experiences?
